								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Organizers</b><br />
Jes A. Koepfler, University of Maryland, US<br />
Luke Stark, New York University, USA<br />
Paul Dourish, University of California, Irvine, USA<br />
Phoebe Sengers, Cornell University, USA<br />
Katie Shilton, University of Maryland, USA</p>
<p><b>Key Dates</b></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>January 24, 2014 – Position papers due in CHI Extended Abstracts format</li>
<li>February 10, 2014 – Notifications go out to potential participants</li>
<li>April 27, 2014 – Meet in Toronto, ON, for the Values &amp; Design in HCI Education workshop</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Workshop Summary</b><br />
How do we teach future engineers, designers, and citizens to understand values issues that arise in the design of technologies, and to identify and embody specific values in design? This one-day workshop, on Sunday, April 27, 2014, will bring together researchers and practitioners in human-computer interaction (HCI), information science, product design, the learning sciences, educational technology, and related fields to share and develop research, strategies, and tools for teaching about values and design in HCI. We will consider learning environments from classrooms to conference workshops, industry events and more. Through group discussion and exercises, participants will develop solutions to the challenges of theorizing, describing, and teaching about values and design.</p>
<p><b>Topics</b><br />
Together, workshop participants will explore:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Ways of discussing <i>values</i> with learners in a design context</li>
<li>Tools, approaches, and core questions related to values and design</li>
<li>Best practices and material approaches to values and design</li>
<li>Gaps in existing pedagogy and intersections with other approaches in HCI education</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Participants</b><br />
The intended workshop size is 15-20 people. Interested participants should submit a 2 &#8211; 4 page position paper that describes their interests and experiences in the workshop topic using the CHI Extended Abstracts format. Submissions should be sent to <a href="mailto:koepfler@umd.edu">koepfler@umd.edu</a> by January 24, 2014. Successful submissions will report on experiences teaching or exploring values and design, and report on successes, limitations, or both of particular approaches. At least one author of each accepted position paper must attend the workshop and all participants must register for the workshop and at least one day of the conference. Submission notifications will be sent by February 10, 2014.</p>
<p><b>Workshop Plan</b><br />
<b>Pre-workshop</b> (2-4 weeks prior): The organizers will facilitate a pre-workshop discussion via email on what “values and design” means to the participants. Each participant will briefly describe his/her framing of values, design, and the relationship between the two, along with 2-3 key references. The goal of this exercise is not to come to consensus on a unified definition of either values or design, but to identify the complexity of the topic and illuminate how that complex nature might affect approaches to teaching about values in HCI education.</p>
<p><b>Warm up</b> (30 mins): To start the workshop, the organizers will provide a synthesis of participant responses from the pre-workshop discussion and set out the goals and agenda for the workshop.</p>
<p><b>Share</b> (60 mins): Participants will form small groups and share examples of approaches they have used to teach values in design, emphasizing both successes and failures of the approach.</p>
<p><b>Report</b> (30 mins): Groups will be asked to synthesize their findings from the sharing session and describe best practices and lessons learned across approaches.</p>
<p><b>Practice &amp; Critique</b> (60 mins): Best practices and lessons learned from the groups will be used as a framework for evaluating specific approaches to teaching values and design, including Envisioning Cards, Values-at-Play, values levers, and design workbooks. Each organizer will take on the role of instructor and guide a small group through an exercise using a technique. Group members, in the role of learners, will use the framework from the morning session to critique the approaches. Together the groups will refine new ways to use those methods for engaging students, practitioners, and other researchers.</p>
<p><b>Report</b> (30 mins): After lunch, groups will report on their new approaches to using techniques for teaching about values and design.</p>
<p><b>Create</b> (90 mins): With a set of criteria and best practices in place, new groups will form to apply lessons from the day into new tools for teaching values and design. Groups may choose to co-create a course syllabus, conference workshop, begin a report or publication for the <i>SIGCHI Bulletin</i> or <i>interactions</i>, or engage in another tangible deliverable related to values and design in HCI education.</p>
<p><b>Report &amp; Synthesize</b> (60 mins): The workshop will end with a roundup of insights and opportunities for future work, including outlining an article for interactions magazine about compelling practices for addressing values and design in HCI education.</p>
<p><b>Ongoing</b>: Throughout the day, the organizers will document conversations and artifacts of the groups’ efforts, and participants will leave with a set of vetted approaches and tools for teaching values and design.</p>
<p><b>Post-workshop</b>: Workshop participants and organizers will collaboratively create a poster based on the results of the workshop to be presented at the CHI 2014 workshop poster session. Papers and projects presented at and created during the workshop, will be collected and added to <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/vid/education.html">an existing online repository</a> to further support dissemination of the group’s effort through other outlets such as the <i>SIGCHI Bulletin, interactions</i>, or other appropriate journals/scholarly magazines.</p>
