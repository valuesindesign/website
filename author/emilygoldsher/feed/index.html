								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:small;"><a href="http://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/ili">The Information Law Institute</a> at NYU is accepting applications for research fellowships in the area of information law and policy to begin in Fall 2015. The initial fellowship term is for one year, with the possibility of renewal for a second year. Applicants should hold law degrees or Ph.D.s in relevant fields. We will give preference to applicants with demonstrated expertise or interest in ILI focus areas, including privacy, information ethics and politics, and cybersecurity.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">Fellows are expected to devote time to their own research, to collaborative projects, and to planning ILI events. Teaching in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communication may be an option, depending on availability and interest. Collaborative projects, which may be supervised by Helen Nissenbaum (ILI Director and Professor of Media, Culture, and Communication), Katherine Strandburg (Professor of Law), or Ira Rubinstein (ILI Senior Fellow) will be on topics of mutual interest to fellow and supervisor, with two particular areas of focus for 2015-16: i) privacy in the context of media use and engagement and ii) developing normatively defensible and legally implementable alternatives for regulating access to and use of information in the hands of third party intermediaries.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">Fellows are expected to reside in the New York area and to participate in Information Law Institute activities, including the multidisciplinary Privacy Research Group. They also have ample opportunity to interact with other faculty in the School of Law and other departments at NYU, and to take part in the intellectual life of the university. For further information about the ILI and the Privacy Research Group, see <a href="http://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/ili/index.htm.">http://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/ili/index.htm</a>.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">Applications should be sent by email to ILI administrator <a href="mailto:nicole.arzt@nyu.edu">Nicole Arzt</a>, and should include: a CV, copies of 2 relevant publications or writing samples, a transcript of graduate work (unofficial is acceptable), the names and contact information of three references, and a cover letter summarizing the candidates relevant background and accomplishments and outlining his or her perceived fit with the ILI. We will begin reviewing applications on February 15 and continue until the positions are filled.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Available in bookstores in late July 2014.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Values-at-Play-Digital-Games/dp/0262027666/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402064927&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=values+at+play+flanagan" target="_blank"><strong> Pre-order now from Amazon</strong></a>.</p>
<p>All games express and embody human values, providing a compelling arena in which we play out beliefs and ideas. “Big ideas” such as justice, equity, honesty, and cooperation—as well as other kinds of ideas, including violence, exploitation, and greed— may emerge in games whether designers intend them or not. In this book, Mary Flanagan and Helen Nissenbaum present Values at Play, a theoretical and practical framework for identifying socially recognized moral and political values in digital games. Values at Play can also serve as a guide to designers who seek to implement values in the conception and design of their games. After developing a theoretical foundation for their proposal, Flanagan and Nissenbaum provide detailed examinations of selected games, demonstrating the many ways in which values are embedded in them. They introduce the Values at Play heuristic, a systematic approach for incorporating values into the game design process. Interspersed among the book’s chapters are texts by designers who have put Values at Play into practice by accepting values as a design constraint like any other, offering a real-world perspective on the design challenges involved.</p>

<p>Comments on <em>Values at Play</em></p>
<p>“<em>Values at Play in Digital Games</em> gives the reader a powerful set of tools for examining the cultural, ethical, and political meanings of video games, and reminds us that a consideration of the values embodied in digital play is an integral part of the game design process.”<br />
<strong>Richard Lemarchand</strong>, <em>Associate Professor, University of Southern California; Lead Designer, Uncharted</em></p>
<p>“<em>Values at Play in Digital Games</em> is an invaluable toolbox for understanding the values embedded in existing games and for making new games that express the values we believe in.”<br />
<strong>Jesper Juul</strong>, <em>video game theorist; author of Half-Real and The Art of Failure</em></p>
<p>“Flanagan and Nissenbaum boldly step into the deep and turbulent waters of aesthetics and values in games. An essential read for designers who believe in the power of games to change minds.”<br />
<strong>Asi Burak</strong>, <em>President, Games for Change; Faculty at the School of Visual Arts</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Functioning as part of the <a href="http://www.nets-fia.net/">NSF Future Internet Architecture Project</a>, the <a title="Values in Design Council" href="https://valuesindesign.wordpress.com/initiatives-2/values-in-design-council/">Values in Design Council</a> serves as a multi-disciplinary team of experts in the social analysis of digital information technologies. The team acts as analysts and consultants to the FIA projects, helping to identify junctures in the design process in which values-critical technical decisions arise.</p>
<p>The Values In Design Council for Future Internet Architectures – Next Phase (VID4FIA-NP) will work alongside the project winners of the National Science Foundation’s Future Internet Architecture large awards, <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=131248" target="_blank">announced in late April 2014</a>. The aim is to build a unique forum for interposing questions and ideas about social, political, and ethical values in an ongoing dialog with computer scientists and engineers engaged in designing and developing Internet technologies.</p>
<p>The ideal VID4FIA-NP Council includes 16 members from different fields and career stages, whose work, one way or another, has been inspired by the notion that values, such as security, openness, accessibility, privacy, etc. are embodied in socio­technical systems, and further, that these values be considered not only post­ hoc with design patches and stopgap policy but fruitfully integrated throughout design and development. Next Phase awards, unlike the first phase of the projects, will be focused on applications, oriented around the specifics of the context of deployment.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Organizers</b><br />
Jes A. Koepfler, University of Maryland, US<br />
Luke Stark, New York University, USA<br />
Paul Dourish, University of California, Irvine, USA<br />
Phoebe Sengers, Cornell University, USA<br />
Katie Shilton, University of Maryland, USA</p>
<p><b>Key Dates</b></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>January 24, 2014 – Position papers due in CHI Extended Abstracts format</li>
<li>February 10, 2014 – Notifications go out to potential participants</li>
<li>April 27, 2014 – Meet in Toronto, ON, for the Values &amp; Design in HCI Education workshop</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Workshop Summary</b><br />
How do we teach future engineers, designers, and citizens to understand values issues that arise in the design of technologies, and to identify and embody specific values in design? This one-day workshop, on Sunday, April 27, 2014, will bring together researchers and practitioners in human-computer interaction (HCI), information science, product design, the learning sciences, educational technology, and related fields to share and develop research, strategies, and tools for teaching about values and design in HCI. We will consider learning environments from classrooms to conference workshops, industry events and more. Through group discussion and exercises, participants will develop solutions to the challenges of theorizing, describing, and teaching about values and design.</p>
<p><b>Topics</b><br />
Together, workshop participants will explore:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Ways of discussing <i>values</i> with learners in a design context</li>
<li>Tools, approaches, and core questions related to values and design</li>
<li>Best practices and material approaches to values and design</li>
<li>Gaps in existing pedagogy and intersections with other approaches in HCI education</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Participants</b><br />
The intended workshop size is 15-20 people. Interested participants should submit a 2 &#8211; 4 page position paper that describes their interests and experiences in the workshop topic using the CHI Extended Abstracts format. Submissions should be sent to <a href="mailto:koepfler@umd.edu">koepfler@umd.edu</a> by January 24, 2014. Successful submissions will report on experiences teaching or exploring values and design, and report on successes, limitations, or both of particular approaches. At least one author of each accepted position paper must attend the workshop and all participants must register for the workshop and at least one day of the conference. Submission notifications will be sent by February 10, 2014.</p>
<p><b>Workshop Plan</b><br />
<b>Pre-workshop</b> (2-4 weeks prior): The organizers will facilitate a pre-workshop discussion via email on what “values and design” means to the participants. Each participant will briefly describe his/her framing of values, design, and the relationship between the two, along with 2-3 key references. The goal of this exercise is not to come to consensus on a unified definition of either values or design, but to identify the complexity of the topic and illuminate how that complex nature might affect approaches to teaching about values in HCI education.</p>
<p><b>Warm up</b> (30 mins): To start the workshop, the organizers will provide a synthesis of participant responses from the pre-workshop discussion and set out the goals and agenda for the workshop.</p>
<p><b>Share</b> (60 mins): Participants will form small groups and share examples of approaches they have used to teach values in design, emphasizing both successes and failures of the approach.</p>
<p><b>Report</b> (30 mins): Groups will be asked to synthesize their findings from the sharing session and describe best practices and lessons learned across approaches.</p>
<p><b>Practice &amp; Critique</b> (60 mins): Best practices and lessons learned from the groups will be used as a framework for evaluating specific approaches to teaching values and design, including Envisioning Cards, Values-at-Play, values levers, and design workbooks. Each organizer will take on the role of instructor and guide a small group through an exercise using a technique. Group members, in the role of learners, will use the framework from the morning session to critique the approaches. Together the groups will refine new ways to use those methods for engaging students, practitioners, and other researchers.</p>
<p><b>Report</b> (30 mins): After lunch, groups will report on their new approaches to using techniques for teaching about values and design.</p>
<p><b>Create</b> (90 mins): With a set of criteria and best practices in place, new groups will form to apply lessons from the day into new tools for teaching values and design. Groups may choose to co-create a course syllabus, conference workshop, begin a report or publication for the <i>SIGCHI Bulletin</i> or <i>interactions</i>, or engage in another tangible deliverable related to values and design in HCI education.</p>
<p><b>Report &amp; Synthesize</b> (60 mins): The workshop will end with a roundup of insights and opportunities for future work, including outlining an article for interactions magazine about compelling practices for addressing values and design in HCI education.</p>
<p><b>Ongoing</b>: Throughout the day, the organizers will document conversations and artifacts of the groups’ efforts, and participants will leave with a set of vetted approaches and tools for teaching values and design.</p>
<p><b>Post-workshop</b>: Workshop participants and organizers will collaboratively create a poster based on the results of the workshop to be presented at the CHI 2014 workshop poster session. Papers and projects presented at and created during the workshop, will be collected and added to <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/vid/education.html">an existing online repository</a> to further support dissemination of the group’s effort through other outlets such as the <i>SIGCHI Bulletin, interactions</i>, or other appropriate journals/scholarly magazines.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In NYU-Poly&#8217;s third, eagerly anticipated Sloan Cyber Security Lecture, Federal Trade Commissioner Julie Brill explores the expanding collection and use of Big Data in the marketplace, recognizing the challenges it presents for consumers and businesses&#8211;as well as for agencies like the Federal Trade Commission, responsible for safeguarding both. Commissioner Brill embraces the enormous benefits offered by Big Data analytics, but also believes it presents fundamental challenges to traditional notions of individual privacy. She encourages the highly decentralized community of Big Data purveyors to adopt practices that follow laws that already govern the way data can be used and calls for industry to engage in robust de-identification of consumer data. She concludes by taking us through her comprehensive initiative, &#8220;Reclaim Your Name,&#8221; to give consumers knowledge and tools to reassert control over their personal data. RSVP to attend <a href="http://www.poly.edu/events/2013/10/23/reclaim-your-name-privacy-world-big-data">here</a>.</p>
